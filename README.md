This is an Android-based easy-to-use women safety app designed to provide reliable safety tools for women.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
Violence against women is a persistent issue, especially in South Asia, where legal protections are often insufficient. This has led to a significant increase in crimes against women, with very few resulting in convictions.

Our android app aims to mitigate these issues by continuously monitoring the user's location and offering a way to share their whereabouts with trusted contacts.

## 📱 Features
- **Emergency Alert:** Users can press a panic button to send SMS with google maps location and calls to emergency contacts and services.
- **Real-Time GPS Tracking:** Emergency contacts can track the user's location, route and captured images and audios.
- **Incident Recording:** The app records audio and images every 5 seconds from front and back camera when the panic button is activated.
- **Unsafe Zone Locator:** Marks areas as unsafe based on reported incidents that occured in that place. 
- **Educational Resources:** Provides safety tips and self-defense techniques.
